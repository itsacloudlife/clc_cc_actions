Steampipe Mod

## Howto
Make sure your `AWS_PROFILE` (or other credentials) are set, and simply run steampipe dashboard.
It should open up a browser window to the correct port.

```
steampipe dashboard
```

## Notes
You can leave the steampipe dashboard process running and when you update any of the 
dashboard `*.sp` files, it will auto load them and refresh the web page.  Neat stuff.
